Title: The battle of CI/CD in Cloud Native
Abstract: As a bridge between source codes and product value, CI/CD is playing a very important role. There're many solutions was emerged. Some of them are an open source project, or some just provide the service. Jenkins has a great and very active open community, also has a long history. How does Jenkins could continuously keep a leader ship in the cloud native ecosystem? Especially more and more companies put their products in the kubernetes. Argo is another wonderful CI/CD platform which is kubernetes-based. Let's see how do we choose between Jenkins X, Argo and other solution!
Benefit: Introduce the full picture of CI/CD ecosystem. Giving some deep thoughts from a contributor of the Jenkins community.

Title: Cloud Native's CI/CD battle
Abstract: As a bridge between source code and product value, Cloud Native CI/CD solutions are playing a very important role, hence many solutions are continuously emerging: From open source projects to SaaS. With the increasing adoptions of Kubernetes by multiple enterprises, choosing the correct CI/CD solution can be crucial to quickly achieve success. Jenkins, besides its great and very active and vibrant community, has a long and successful history. How can Jenkins continuously keep its leadership in the Cloud Native ecosystem?  Argo is another wonderful, Kubernetes native, CI/CD platform. In this talk, we will deeply explore multiple CI/CD solutions for Kubernetes, their benefits, and pitfalls.
Benefit: Introduce the full picture of CI/CD ecosystem. Providing some deep thoughts from a Jenkins community contributor.

Title: How to build a Serverless CI/CD Pipeline
Abstract: We are facing the a big problem in a demanding CI/CD system. What's really impossible keeping one master always alives. Do we have a better solution? Multiple master or not? I belive that a serverless CI/CD pipeline system could brings you a wonderful experience. Using the strengths of Kubernetes to focus on the real requirement, don't need to manage nodes anymore. No cost for idel time. Launch 10,000+ builds/containers in seconds. Thoese are what a Serverless CI/CD Pipeline system could offers you.
Benefit: A chance for community members and enterprises to build their own high availabe, less idel and easy maintenance CI/CD pipeline.

Title: How to build a Serverless CI/CD Pipeline
Abstract: With more demanding CI/CD requirements, it becomes critical to keep all workflows responsive at all time. To achieve such goal the architecture of the CI/CD system is of paramount importance. In some systems having Master/Node approach, such as Jenkins, keeping the Master alive is crucial. Are there any other solutions that not only solve this problem but take it even further? To make the best use of all available resources, a Kubernetes based Serverless CI/CD solution, would not only solve resource management challenges but also improve the overall user experience, without creating step learning curves to its maintainers. In this talk, we will explore together a solution that is able to launch 10,000+ builds/containers in seconds.
Benefit: A chance for community members and enterprises to build their own high available, less idle and easy maintenance CI/CD pipeline.
